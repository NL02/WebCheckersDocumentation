Running the application:
1. Make sure you have Maven installed correctly.
2. Use the command line to navigate to the directory where you have unzipped
   the application.
3. Execute this command to run the application:
   mvn compile exec:java
4. Open a new browser window. If you are hosting on your computer, go to
   localhost:4567. If someone else is hosting and you want to connect to them,
   replace localhost with their IPv4 address. They can find it by running the
   command ipconfig.
5. To test with a second player on the same computer, open a new window in
   incognito mode or your browser's equivalent, and go to localhost:4567 as
   before.
6. Testing spectator mode will require two devices. As before, use localhost:4567
   if the spectator will be on the host's device and replace localhost with the
   IP address if it will be a separate device.
7. Computers are required to test game functionality, but spectate mode can be
   tested via smartphone.

Notes on our implementation:
1. There is a known bug where dropping a piece onto another piece causes an
   uncaught JavaScript error, which leaves the player unable to move pieces.
   Refreshing the page will restore functionality.
2. Games are started by having one player click "Create Game", which puts them
   into an empty game while they wait for an opponent. Their name is added to a
   list of open games on the home page. The second player clicks that name to
   join and start the game. When they do, this adds the game to the list of
   games that can be spectated.
